# Qt Design Viewer

## About
Launch [Design Studio](https://www.qt.io/ui-design-tools) projects in Your web browser. Or share Your design on the web. The viewer that helps you do this is done with [Qt for WebAssembly](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/wasm.html). The underlying technologies are [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) & [emscripten](https://emscripten.org/).

Qt Design Viewer works in a variety of web browsers which support WebAssembly, on Desktop and even on mobile.

## Usage
Compress Your Qml project as a _.zip_ file, ideally including a _.qmlproject_ file. Or use the _Build -> Generate Resource File_ feature of Qt Design Studio 1.3+ to pack Your project in a _.qmlrc_ file.

The Qt Design Viewer lets You drop the _.zip_/_.qmlrc_, or load it via a file selector.
